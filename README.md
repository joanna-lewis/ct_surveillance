# Notebooks for analysing chlamydia surveillance data for England.

For the reader's convenience, the notebooks have been downloaded as html files, and the code and Figures can be viewed using a web browser.
To run or edit the code and generate figures, the necessary software to run iPython and Jupyter notebooks must be installed (see http://ipython.org/install.html and http://jupyter.org/). 

`three_compartment_model.ipynb` introduces the model and its properties.

`england.ipynb` illustrates the use of the model, using data from England in 2012.

`local_authorities.ipynb` uses the model to investigate local differences in chlamydia testing and diagnosis rates, incidence and prevalence.

Also included is an R script which is used to derive prior distributions for the proportions of men and women in different age groups who are sexually active, using data from the National Study of Sexual Attitudes and Lifestyles, Natsal-3.

Natsal-3 data is available from the UK Data Archive:
